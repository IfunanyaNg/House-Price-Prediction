1. Introduction
In this project, we aimed to predict house prices in California using a variety of features such as location, median income, population density, and housing characteristics. The problem we addressed is understanding how various factors influence house prices and developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict these prices based on the input features.

The business case for this model is to provide real estate companies, homebuyers, and policymakers with a tool to estimate house prices, thereby helping in making informed decisions. Accurate house price predictions can help in pricing strategies, investment decisions, and understanding regional disparities in housing markets.

2. Data Overview and Preprocessing
Data Overview:

The dataset used consists of various features related to housing in California, including median house value (our target variable), geographic information, and socioeconomic factors.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Imputation techniques were applied to handle missing values.
Feature Engineering: New features such as median_house_value_class, population_density, rooms_per_household, and bedrooms_per_room were created to provide more insights.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features like ocean_proximity were encoded using one-hot encoding.
Normalization: Numerical features were normalized to ensure that they contribute equally to the model.
3. Methodology
Model Selection:

Four different models were evaluated: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

We applied GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor. The hyperparameters tuned included n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.
Model Evaluation:

The models were evaluated using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.
The best-performing model was further evaluated on the test set.

Feature Importance:

The most critical features in predicting house prices were:
median_income (48.39%)
ocean_proximity_INLAND (14.57%)
population_density (12.16%)
longitude (5.79%)
latitude (5.66%)
5. Visualizations
Scatter Plot: Actual vs. Predicted House Prices

This plot shows a strong correlation between actual and predicted prices, with points closely aligned to the 45-degree line, indicating accurate predictions.
Residual Distribution Plot:

The residuals are symmetrically distributed around zero, following a bell-shaped curve. This suggests that the model's errors are normally distributed, indicating good model performance.
6. Conclusion
The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with an RMSE of 50620.10 and an R² Score of 0.8152 on the test set. The model shows that median_income is the most significant predictor of house prices, followed by geographic location features like ocean_proximity_INLAND, population_density, and longitude.

Recommendations:

Model Improvement: While the model performs well, further improvements could involve exploring more complex models like deep learning, or adding more granular features such as neighborhood-specific data.
Deployment: The model is ready for deployment in real-world applications to predict house prices, assist in real estate investment decisions, and guide policy-making.
Future Work: Investigating the influence of additional features or external economic factors could provide even more accurate predictions.
