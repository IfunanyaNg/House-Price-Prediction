Project Summary: Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as median income, proximity to the ocean, and population density. Using the California Housing Dataset, I explored key factors that influence house prices and tested multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

After rigorous evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.8152 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 50,620.10. The model demonstrated that median income, location, and population density are critical determinants of house prices.

This project highlights my ability to handle real-world data, apply advanced machine learning techniques, and derive actionable insights, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
